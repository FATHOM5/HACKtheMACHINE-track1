  # List the unique PGN numbers as a comma separated string. All numbers should be integers
  SoManyMessages: "0,1,2,3"

  # Up to 525 pts
  # List all the nmea sources (in decimal as integers) and your guess for the device type.
  # Items from the list can be used more than once. If you do not know
  # the device type, you can leave the device type blank.
  #
  # If you are still unsure what this is, the Src field in the nmea packet
  # is the value you are looking for. Make sure to list the srs as integers,
  # rather then hex. So 0x50 is '80'.
  # E.g: If your src byte is 0x50, list it in the yml as `80: "GPS"`
  #
  # Devices to choose from: (Please copy/paste the strings as provided)
  #   "Actisense", "GPS", "ECDIS", "Auto Pilot",
  #   "Throttle Shift", "Throttle Actuator", "Speed",
  #   "Throttle Station", "Throttle Control Unit"
  WhatIsThis: # Replace the examples!
    # If you find a device with the src byte as 0x01, this is how you would list it
    # if you believe it to be a GPS device.
    1: "GPS"
    # If you find a device with the src byte as 0x02, but do not know what it is, you can
    # leave the device guess blank like this:
    2: ""
    # ... List the rest of the devices ...
    # Src 1&2 are just examples. They might not be correct.


  # Up to 370 pts
  # List the PGN numbers (in decimal as integers) and their update interval over the nmea network.
  # If a pgn is being sent every 200ms or at 5per second, then the interval is "200ms".
  # You should list all the pgns you found in `SoManyMessages`.
  #
  # List the PGN numbers as integers, NOT hex!!
  #
  # !! Do not put in the frequency, put in the interval !!
  TalkFast: # Replace the examples!
    # pgn 100 is sent every 1s
    100: "1s"
    # pgn 200 is sent every 100ms (10 per second)
    200: "100ms"
    # ... List the rest of the pgns ...
    # PGN numbers 100 & 200 are examples and are incorrect. PGNs 100 & 200
    # do not even exist.

  # Up to 250 pts
  # Replace the default values with your guess to the spoofed msg/pgn on the nmea network.
  # A spoofed message is one created by software and not from an actual nmea device.
  SpoofedMessage:
    # The PGN number of the messages being spoofed
    PGNNum: 0 # Expect an integer, not hex or bytes
    # The device type being spoofed (From the device word list in `WhatIsThis`)
    # Put the device type the spoofer is trying to be.
    Device: ""
    # The Nmea source broadcasting the spoofed messages
    Source: 0 # Expect an integer from 0-255. Convert your byte value to an integer.
